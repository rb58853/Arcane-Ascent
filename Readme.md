# Arcane Ascent

![alt text](./Doc/Images/Portada.png)
Arcane Ascent is an innovative digital game that fuses a sophisticated card-based combat system with the traditional mechanics of the roguelike genre. The game implements three distinctive magical specializations: the Elemental Mage, specialized in the mastery of natural elements; the Summoner Mage, dedicated to the summoning of supernatural entities; and the Blood Mage, skilled in the manipulation of life essence. The technical structure of the game is developed on Unity with C#, rigorously incorporating SOLID principles and agile development methodologies. A particularly notable feature is its evolutionary card system, where each specialization has a unique and exclusive library of magic cards.

## History

At the dawn of history, when the Winds of Magic swept the world, immense power arose in defense against the ambition of a singular Witch Queen in her towering Tower. She attempted to master the very essence of magic, but magic, capricious and wild, resisted her control, unleashing a massive cataclysm that trapped her and her entire entourage for a thousand years. This magical cataclysm not only shook the foundations of the world but also awakened the gods and the elements themselves, corrupting all the people of the Tower with its corrupting influence. Today, after a thousand years of captivity, the Tower's door has finally been opened, attracting hundreds of sorcerers from all corners of the world who crave the power that lies at the bottom of this Tower.
